balance = "Whatever user inputs as starting balance"
rate = " interest rate x .01"
contribution = "amount user is willing to contribute"


Every month, the contribution is subtracted from the outstanding balance if not
$0. The new total is the balance - contribution but the new amount has added
interest.

I think I write it as:
    new_balance = balance - contribution

balance += balance * rate ?
